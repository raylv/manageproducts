// Helper class for nw.epm.refapps.products.manage.model.Products. It provides generic handling when the UI5 OData
// DELETE service is called. The public functions in this class should give business semantics for the application (such
// as DELETE product(s), DELETE product draft, DELETE product image, with or without user confirmation). Currently the
// Products class uses this class by creating a transient instance on demand in order to execute exactly one (public)
// method of this class. However, this class is agnostic about this pattern. Note that instances of this class are
// created on demand (that is, immediately before the required public method of this class is executed) and garbage
// collected.
//
// Note that the entities to be deleted are always specified by paths (strings) in the OData model. For convenience,
// this class is tolerant on whether the path starts with "/" or not. See function fnGetPathWithSlash.
